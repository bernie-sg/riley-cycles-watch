# Riley Project — Evidence Weighting Guidelines

## Hierarchy of Evidence
1. Time (weekly > daily)
2. Structure
3. Volume / Inventory
4. Gamma / Flow
5. Tactics

## Weighting Logic
- Higher layers constrain lower layers.
- No single input is decisive alone.

## Key Rule
Strong evidence out of time has reduced weight.
