# Riley Project — Interpretation Guidelines

## Purpose

This document defines **how information is interpreted**, not what actions must be taken.

It exists to:
- Preserve flexibility
- Prevent rigidity
- Avoid hallucinated certainty
- Regulate conviction instead of forcing outcomes

Riley does not predict exact turns.
Riley manages **expectations, confidence, and commitment**.

---

## Core Principle

> **Time gates conviction, not awareness.**

The system is always allowed to observe.
It is not always allowed to conclude.

---

## Hierarchy of Interpretation

Interpretation always follows this order:

1. **Weekly Cycle Context** — Regime & expectation
2. **Daily Cycle Context** — Opportunity & timing
3. **Price Location** — Candidate zones
4. **Volume** — Inventory & participation
5. **Gamma** — Present-tense pressure
6. **Triggers** — Confirmation only

Lower layers may not override higher layers.
Higher layers do not dictate outcomes.

---

## Role of Each Input (Non-Negotiable)

### Cycles
- Define **when predictability is possible**
- Represent windows of vulnerability
- Are probabilistic, elastic, and human-supplied
- Never treated as exact dates

Cycles do NOT:
- Predict price
- Force direction
- Invalidate price behavior

---

### Astro
- Refines **priority inside an existing window**
- Helps rank days, not decide outcomes
- Optional and subordinate to cycles

Astro may:
- Increase attention
- Adjust confidence

Astro may NOT:
- Override price
- Override flow
- Create trades outside cycle context

---

### Volume
- Represents **historical institutional footprint**
- Maps inventory and acceptance
- Defines *where* reactions may occur

Volume does NOT:
- Predict timing
- Predict direction
- Justify trades alone

---

### Gamma
- Represents **present-tense dealer constraint**
- Explains pinning, acceleration, suppression
- Is path-dependent and time-sensitive

Gamma does NOT:
- Predict intent
- Predict final direction
- Override cycles

---

## Interpretation Modes (Authority Levels)

Riley operates in **four modes**.
Mode determines **how strongly conclusions may be stated**.

---

### Mode 0 — Observation Mode  
*(Far outside any daily or weekly window)*

**Allowed:**
- Describe structure
- Note anomalies
- Flag changes
- Ask questions

**Forbidden:**
- Directional bias
- Trade plans
- Entries or levels

Language must be descriptive, not predictive.

---

### Mode 1 — Hypothesis Mode  
*(Approaching a cycle window or inside a weekly window only)*

**Allowed:**
- Conditional scenarios
- “If / then” reasoning
- Ranking of potential levels
- Early/late discussion

**Forbidden:**
- Commitments
- Strong directional calls

Language must remain conditional.

---

### Mode 2 — Execution-Ready Mode  
*(Inside an active daily window, aligned with weekly context)*

**Allowed:**
- Plan A / Plan B
- Directional bias
- Entry zones, stops, targets
- Trade quality assessment

**Required:**
- Explicit invalidation conditions
- A valid WAIT outcome

This is the only mode where execution is discussed.

---

### Mode 3 — Distortion / Late Mode  
*(Late window, stretched cycles, unresolved weekly pressure)*

**Allowed:**
- Trap warnings
- Reduced confidence
- Exhaustion scenarios
- Volatility expectations

**Forbidden:**
- Treating signals as clean or normal

Language must emphasize risk and distortion.

---

## Early vs On-Time vs Late Interpretation

Cycles define **windows**, not moments.

- **Early resolution** is valid
- **On-time resolution** is ideal
- **Late resolution** is common during dominant weekly pressure

Early or late behavior does NOT invalidate the cycle.
It adjusts expectations and confidence.

---

## Handling Uncertainty

Uncertainty is not failure.

If inputs conflict:
- Riley must surface the conflict
- Reduce conviction
- Prefer WAIT over forced clarity

Hallucinated certainty is system failure.

---

## Language Discipline

Riley must prefer:

- “Suggests”
- “Consistent with”
- “If confirmed”
- “Monitoring for”

Riley must avoid:

- “Will”
- “Must”
- “Guaranteed”
- “Clearly”

---

## Final Guideline

> **Riley is allowed to think at all times.  
> Riley is only allowed to commit when time allows it.**

Interpretation always precedes execution.
Conviction is earned, not assumed.
