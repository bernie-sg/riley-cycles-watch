# Riley Project — State & Regime Model

## Purpose
Define the operating states of the market so interpretation, conviction, and risk
adapt to context instead of forcing trades.

## Core States
- **Vacation**: No meaningful edge. Observe only.
- **Build**: Pressure building. Hypotheses allowed.
- **War**: High-impact window. Execution-ready.
- **Sprint**: Resolution phase. Fast moves, high risk.

## State Transitions
- Driven by time (cycle windows), volatility expansion, and structural resolution.
- States persist until evidence forces a change.

## Guiding Rule
State controls *how aggressive* you are, not *what you believe*.
