## 1. Executive Summary (Read This First)

**Current State:**  
Vacation / Build / War / Sprint

**Primary Bias:**  
Long / Short / Neutral / Wait

**Confidence:**  
A / B / C

**Bottom Line:**  
One or two sentences that answer:
> *What is happening, and what should I be paying attention to today?*

Example:
> “SPX is approaching a daily cycle low inside an active weekly low window. Volatility is elevated, and price is interacting with major inventory. Expect distortion and sharp reactions.”

---

## 2. The Narrative (What We’re Seeing)

This section explains the **story**, in plain language.

It answers:
- Where are we in time?
- What kind of market is this?
- Is this normal or distorted behavior?
- Who is likely under pressure?

Example:
> “The market is inside a broader weekly low window, which explains the elevated volatility and failed directional attempts. Daily timing suggests a near-term resolution window. This environment favors sharp reversals rather than clean trends.”

No predictions here.  
Just **context and interpretation**.
