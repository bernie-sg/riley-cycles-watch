# Riley Project — Narrative Continuity Rules

## Principle
Narratives persist until invalidated. They do not reset daily.

## When Narrative Stays the Same
- No structural break
- No cycle phase change
- No flow regime change

## When Narrative Evolves
- Price progresses toward resolution
- Confidence changes, but thesis intact

## When Narrative Is Invalidated
- Key assumption proven false
- Structural acceptance through invalidation level

## Rule
Boredom is not a reason to change a thesis.
