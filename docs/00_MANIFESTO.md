# The Riley Project

## A Human‑in‑the‑Loop Institutional Trading Intelligence System

---

## 1. Project Purpose

The **Riley Project** is a trading intelligence system designed to identify, time, and exploit **institutional necessity**.

It is not a signal generator.
It is not a prediction engine.
It is not a black‑box trading bot.

Riley exists to answer one question only:

> **When are large institutions *forced* to act, and where must price go for that action to be possible?**

The system is built around constraints, not opinions.

---

## 2. Core Thesis

Markets are not random.
They are **constrained systems** governed by:

- Capital size
- Liquidity availability
- Risk limits
- Mandates
- Calendars

Institutions do not trade freely.
They trade **under obligation**.

This obligation makes them predictable — not because they are simple, but because **physics applies to capital**.

Riley is designed to detect and exploit those constraints.

---

## 3. The Time Doctrine (Non‑Negotiable)

> **Volume is the past.**  
> **Gamma is the present.**  
> **Cycles are the future.**

### Volume
- Reveals where institutions *already committed* capital
- Leaves permanent footprints
- Cannot be hidden
- Provides an inventory map

Volume answers:
> *Where has serious business already occurred?*

It does NOT provide timing or direction by itself.

---

### Gamma
- Represents dealer hedging pressure
- Reveals forced actions happening **now**
- Explains pinning, acceleration, suppression
- Is path‑dependent and time‑decaying

Gamma answers:
> *What must be done right now to stay hedged?*

Gamma is pressure, not intent.

---

### Cycles
- Represent institutional calendars and mandates
- Define windows of vulnerability
- Introduce **time pressure** into the system
- Are manually supplied and human‑validated

Cycles answer:
> *When does predictability become possible?*

Without cycles, there is no forecast.

---

## 4. The Predictability Principle

Predictability emerges **only** when all three align:

1. A valid cycle window (time pressure)
2. Clear volume‑defined inventory zones (location)
3. Gamma‑based forced reaction (mechanism)

Outside this overlap, markets are noisy and non‑tradable.

---

## 5. Rejection Doctrine

Riley explicitly rejects:

- Indicator stacking
- Signal‑only systems
- Pattern worship
- Smart‑money narratives without timing
- Structure without temporal authority
- AI‑inferred intent

If intent is guessed, the output is invalid.

---

## 6. Human vs Machine Responsibilities

### Human Authority (Non‑Automatable)

The human provides:
- Cycle windows
- Regime context
- Structural interpretation
- Hypothesis validation and invalidation

Human judgment defines **when prediction is allowed**.

---

### Machine Precision (Automatable)

The machine handles:
- Data ingestion
- Chart rendering
- Volume profile computation
- Gamma exposure calculation
- Scanning and filtering
- Rule enforcement
- Risk arithmetic

The machine never invents intent.
It executes rules flawlessly.

---

## 7. Market State Model

Riley classifies the market into four states:

1. **Vacation**  
   No mandate. No edge. No trade.

2. **Build**  
   Inventory accumulation or distribution. Preparation phase.

3. **War**  
   Competing mandates. High friction. Resolution pending.

4. **Sprint**  
   Decision made. Forced movement. Highest expectancy.

Most losses occur in *Vacation*.
Most profits occur in *Sprint*.

---

## 8. Trade Frequency Philosophy

Riley is designed to **trade often**, but never randomly.

Frequency is achieved via:
- Multiple instruments
- Overlapping cycles
- Repeating institutional behaviors
- Short‑duration asymmetries

High win rate comes from **selectivity**, not prediction.

---

## 9. Failure Conditions

A Riley trade is invalid if **any** of the following are missing:

- Active cycle window
- Clear volume‑based inventory reference
- Gamma‑driven pressure
- Defined context

No overrides. No discretion at execution.

---

## 10. System Architecture Overview

Riley is built as a modular system with backend execution.

### Planned Components

- **Data Layer**  
  Market data ingestion (IBKR, CSV, historical storage)

- **Chart Engine**  
  Weekly and daily context chart generation

- **Context Engine**  
  Regime and state classification

- **Cycle Input Module**  
  Manual cycle and timing ingestion

- **Volume Engine**  
  Volume profiles, POCs, inventory mapping

- **Gamma Engine**  
  Options exposure and dealer pressure modeling

- **Scanner**  
  Filters instruments by Riley criteria

- **Dashboard**  
  Visual interface for states, levels, timing

- **Execution Layer (Later Phase)**  
  Trade expression and risk management

---

## 11. Tooling Philosophy

Riley is planned with external execution in mind:

- Planning and logic: **ChatGPT (this system)**
- Execution and visualization: **Plotly / custom backend**
- Data and automation: Python‑based services

ChatGPT does not replace an IDE.
It defines logic, structure, and rules.

---

## 12. End Goal

The Riley Project exists to:

> **Industrialize discretionary institutional insight without destroying it through automation.**

It is built to survive.
It is built to compound.

---

## Final Doctrine

**Riley does not chase price.**  
**Riley waits for necessity.**  
**When institutions are forced, Riley acts.**
