### 2025-12-19 — Bernard (LEVELS)
- **Scope:** BOTH
- **Price Reference:** OTHER
- **Bullets:**
  - Levels that decide whether 'AI rotation' is done
  - 164 area (weekly cycle support) = the line in the sand
  - Hold + reclaim 179–182 ⇒ rotation is likely temporary; tradable daily-cycle bounce
  - Lose 164 with acceptance ⇒ rotation isn't 'rotation' anymore; it's regime stress, opening 155 then ~142 (downside bands)
