## Recent Desk Notes
### 2025-12-19 — Bernard (SUMMARY)
- **Scope:** BOTH
- **Price Reference:** SPX
- **Bullets:**
  - Still in a trading range, upside is capped – Weekly chart
  - AI plays are getting weaker, 2026 will likely be a lot different than 2025
  - A weekly cycle trough is due 12-1 – 1/19
  - A downside zone is at $6668 – $6601, a move below would be cause for concern – Daily chart
  - More likely ES makes one more low attempt (a re-test / higher-low) rather than the correction being completely finished
  - Daily is stalling under ~6,910 while still inside the weekly trough window
  - Key pivot: If ES accepts above ~6,910, odds shift to "bottom is in"
  - Key pivot: If ES accepts below ~6,727, odds shift to another push down to seek the low
  - *Price levels reference SPX, not ES
