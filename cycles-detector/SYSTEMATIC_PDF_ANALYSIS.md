# Systematic PDF Analysis - Finding Exact SIGMA-L Parameters

## Goal
Find the EXACT wavelet parameters SIGMA-L uses, not guess.

## Reading Strategy
- Read PDFs in small sections (10-20 lines at a time)
- Document every technical detail
- Save checkpoints after each section
- Look for: Q factor formula, wavelet length, any other parameters

## Files to Read
1. PDF 06 Part 2 (wavelet implementation)
2. PDF 06 Part 3 (if needed)
3. Trade signal PDFs (may contain implementation hints)

## Starting Now
Reading PDF 06 Part 2, looking for technical specifications...
